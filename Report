üìù Project Report: Context-Aware Chatbot Using LangChain or RAG with Gradio Deployment
üîç Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a context-aware conversational chatbot capable of:

Maintaining conversation history (memory)

Retrieving accurate and relevant answers from a custom document corpus

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or LangChain

Deploying the chatbot using Gradio for an interactive user interface

This kind of system is ideal for customer support bots, internal knowledge assistants, or research aids where conversations span multiple turns and rely on large document knowledge bases.

üìö Dataset
A custom corpus is used as the knowledge base. The dataset can be any of the following:

Wikipedia articles

Internal company documentation

Textbooks or academic papers

FAQs or support ticket archives

All documents are preprocessed (cleaned and chunked) before being converted into embeddings.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
Tool	Purpose
LangChain	Chain-based framework for managing LLMs, memory, and tools
FAISS / ChromaDB	Vector store for storing and retrieving document embeddings
SentenceTransformers / OpenAI Embeddings	Generating dense vector representations of text
Gradio	User interface for chatbot deployment
OpenAI / Hugging Face Transformers	Language model backends for generating answers

üß† Key Components
1. Conversational Memory
Using LangChain‚Äôs ConversationBufferMemory or ConversationSummaryMemory, the chatbot remembers prior user inputs and model responses to maintain context throughout the session.

2. Document Embedding and Vectorization
All documents are split into manageable chunks (e.g., 500 tokens with overlap).

Embeddings are generated using sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) or OpenAI API.

Stored in a vector database like FAISS or Chroma for fast similarity search.

3. Retriever Integration
During chat, user queries are vectorized.

Top relevant document chunks are retrieved based on similarity.

These chunks are injected into the prompt for the LLM (RAG approach).

4. Chat Chain Setup
Using LangChain‚Äôs RetrievalQA or custom chains, the chatbot combines:

Chat history (memory)

Retrieved context documents

Prompt templates to construct informative answers

5. Gradio Deployment
The chatbot is wrapped in a simple Gradio interface:

User inputs a query

System displays chat history and model response

Easy to use in notebooks or web deployment

‚úÖ Skills Gained
LangChain Framework: Learned how to integrate LLMs with memory and tools.

Vector Database Use: Implemented document search using FAISS or ChromaDB.

RAG Workflow: Combined retrieval + generation for enhanced responses.

LLM Prompting and Context Handling: Ensured accurate and contextual responses.

Gradio Deployment: Built and launched an interactive UI easily.

üîö Conclusion
This project demonstrates a powerful pattern: combining LLMs with retrieval for real-world applications. The chatbot is scalable, can be expanded with larger corpora, and even fine-tuned or customized with domain-specific knowledge.

Future enhancements may include:

User authentication

PDF/URL ingestion pipeline

Logging and analytics

Multi-modal input (voice/image)
